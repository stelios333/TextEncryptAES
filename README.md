# [TextEncryptAES](https://stelios333.github.io/TextEncryptAES)
A Website to encrypt/decrypt text using CryptoJS and Bootstrap. It is designed to be very easy to use (though that means that only AES is supported), has a nice-looking UI and, of course, it's extremly private. The encryption/decryption happens localy, on the client's device.
